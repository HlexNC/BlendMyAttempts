# BlendMyAttempts
Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.

In this repository I will be posting my attempts to learn Blender.

### Attempt 1  `character`
My first attempt was to create a humanlike character. My plan is to attempt to create a 3D model, and try to create a walking animation for it. 
>Day 1.  For now its going well. I have created a doll like model. Now I just need to add a face and some clothes.

>Day 2.  I have made progress since yesterday In my character creation journey. Today I took a different approach In character modeling.

|Day 1 character is on the right|Day 2  is on the left|
