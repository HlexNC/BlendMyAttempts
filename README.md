# 👉BlendMyJourney

Welcome to BlendMyJourney! This repository is a testament to my journey of learning and mastering Blender, the comprehensive open-source 3D creation suite.

From modeling to rigging, animation to simulation, rendering to compositing, and even motion tracking, video editing and the 2D animation pipeline, Blender encompasses the entirety of the 3D pipeline. Here, you will find my attempts and progression in mastering these aspects.

## 🧍Attempt 1: `Character Modeling and Animation`

I embarked on my Blender journey by attempting to create a humanoid character. My goal was to model a 3D character and animate it with a walking motion.

### Progress Report

**Day 1:** Successfully modeled a doll-like figure. Up next, adding a face and clothing.

**Day 2:** Adopted a new approach to character modeling, resulting in significant progress.

## 🥯Attempt 2: `The Donut Tutorial`

SouthernShotty's video "Get Good at Blender 3D in 2021!" inspired me to follow the Blender Pathway, a structured approach to mastering Blender. My journey through this pathway began with the Blender Guru's beginner tutorial, where I was tasked with creating a donut.

### Progress Report

**Day 4-6:** Created a basic donut and a monkey head on fire. I then added icing to the donut and eventually a shader and sprinkles.

**Day 7:** Completed the second level of the beginner tutorial. The final donut was a sweet success!

**Day 8:** Despite a busy schedule, I managed to model a cup that I'm quite pleased with.

## Attempt 5: 🎃`Halloween Theme`👻

Having taken a respite to focus on academic commitments, I have now returned, full of renewed vigor and passion for my Blender endeavors.😅 The hiatus has been filled with countless hours of modeling and rendering, each attempt better than the last. 

I've been showcasing my creations in the official Discord community and on my Instagram: [@hlexnc](https://www.instagram.com/hlexnc/). Through these platforms, I've had the privilege of building a supportive community of both new and veteran Blender enthusiasts. It's been an incredible journey of discovery and camaraderie, as we navigated the intricacies of 3D modeling together. 

However, life is full of unexpected turns. Currently, my Instagram account has been deactivated, throwing a wrench in my plans 😭. But do all good things truly come to an end, or is this just a bend in the road? 

As I'm working to reactivate my account and reconnect with my community, I remain undeterred. My passion for creating new models and renders remains as strong as ever. I'll continue to post my creations here, in this repository, for everyone to see and draw inspiration from. 

Stay tuned! There are many exciting 3D models on the horizon. My journey with Blender continues and I'm eager to see where it takes me next. 🦾😀
